# Facial-tracking
This program uses the opencv library to take video feed, paired with a harr cascade to detect faces.
The video feed alongside a rectangle that surrounds the face in the frame, is shown in an imshow window.
This can be closed by pressing the "Q" key on the keyboard.
To run this code you will need to use the following command in the terminal: "pip install opencv-python".
